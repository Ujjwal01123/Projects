# 1. Project Name : Joke Danger Meter

## Joke Danger Meter
This repository features the Joke Danger Meter, an interactive web application designed for entertainment purposes to playfully assess the "risk" level of your jokes. It presents various joke categories, allows you to indicate their presence in your humor, and then calculates an arbitrary "chances of jail" percentage.

Disclaimer: This project is for entertainment purposes only and should not be taken seriously. Jokes are subjective, and legal consequences for humor vary widely by context and jurisdiction. Always exercise good judgment and be mindful of your audience!

## ‚ú® Features
