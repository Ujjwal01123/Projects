# 2. Project Name : Currency Converter App

## Currency Converter App
This repository hosts a simple yet functional Currency Converter web application. It allows users to convert amounts between different currencies using real-time exchange rates fetched from an external API. Whether you're planning a trip, managing international finances, or just curious about exchange rates, this tool provides quick and easy conversions.

## ‚ú® Features
Real-time Exchange Rates: Fetches up-to-date currency exchange rates from a reliable API.

Multiple Currency Support: Allows conversion between a wide range of global currencies.

Intuitive User Interface: A clean and easy-to-use interface for selecting currencies and entering amounts.

Instant Conversion: Displays the converted amount as soon as the input or currency selection changes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Conceptually)
The Currency Converter application works by:

User Input: Taking an amount and two currency codes (e.g., USD to EUR) from the user.

API Call: Making a fetch request to an external currency exchange rate API ( Note: You'll need to find a free and reliable API and potentially register for an API key.).

Data Retrieval: Receiving a JSON response containing the latest exchange rates.

Calculation: Using the fetched exchange rate to calculate the converted amount.

Display Result: Showing the calculated converted amount to the user.

## üíª Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the web page content.

CSS3 (Tailwind CSS): For styling the application, ensuring a responsive and modern look.

JavaScript: For handling user input, making API calls, processing data, and dynamically updating the UI.

External API: An external service to provide real-time currency exchange rates.

## üöÄ Getting Started
To run the Currency Converter locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Ujjwal01123/Projects

Navigate to the project directory:

cd projects/tree/main/currency-converter

Obtain an API Key (if required):

Find a free currency exchange rate API (e.g., ExchangeRate-API, Open Exchange Rates, Fixer.io).

Register on their website to obtain your API key.

You will need to integrate this API key into your JavaScript code where the API call is made.

Open index.html: Simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

## üí° Usage
Select the "From" currency from the first dropdown.

Enter the amount you wish to convert in the input field.

Select the "To" currency from the second dropdown.

The converted amount will be displayed automatically.

## üõ£Ô∏è Future Enhancements
Historical Data: Display charts or graphs of historical exchange rates.

Offline Support: Implement caching for basic functionality when offline.

Error Handling: More robust error handling for API failures or invalid inputs.

Visual Enhancements: Add animations or more polished design elements.

Currency Search/Filter: Allow users to search for currencies in the dropdowns.

Favorites: Let users save their most frequently used currency pairs.
