# ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Conceptually)
The Currency Converter application works by:

User Input: Taking an amount and two currency codes (e.g., USD to EUR) from the user.

API Call: Making a fetch request to an external currency exchange rate API ( Note: You'll need to find a free and reliable API and potentially register for an API key.).

Data Retrieval: Receiving a JSON response containing the latest exchange rates.

Calculation: Using the fetched exchange rate to calculate the converted amount.

Display Result: Showing the calculated converted amount to the user.

# üíª Technologies Used

CSS3 (Tailwind CSS): For styling the application, ensuring a responsive and modern look.

JavaScript: For handling user input, making API calls, processing data, and dynamically updating the UI.

External API: An external service to provide real-time currency exchange rates.
