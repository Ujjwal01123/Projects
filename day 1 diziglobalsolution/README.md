# TutStar Blog
A responsive and modern landing page for an online tutoring platform called TutStar. This project features a clean design, a hero section, a features section highlighting unique selling points, and a section showcasing the different educational boards they offer classes for.

The mobile menu slides in from the top of the screen, providing a user-friendly way to access links and buttons on mobile devices.

## Engaging Hero Section:
A prominent hero section with a compelling image and a clear call-to-action to grab the user's attention.

## Unique Features Grid:
A visually appealing grid of cards that highlights the key benefits of the platform, such as small class sizes, flexible subscriptions, and personalized interaction.

## Classes Offered Section:
A dedicated section with clickable cards to showcase the various educational boards (e.g., CBSE, ICSE, MP Board) for which classes are available.

## Modern Styling: 
The design uses a vibrant color palette, subtle shadows, and smooth transitions to create a polished and modern feel.
