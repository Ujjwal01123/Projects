## Joke Danger Meter
This repository features the Joke Danger Meter, an interactive web application designed for entertainment purposes to playfully assess the "risk" level of your jokes. It presents various joke categories, allows you to indicate their presence in your humor, and then calculates an arbitrary "chances of jail" percentage.
