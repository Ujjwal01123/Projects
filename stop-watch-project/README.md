# Stopwatch App
This repository features the Stopwatch App, a simple yet effective web-based stopwatch and timer. Beyond basic timing functionalities, this application allows you to set a specific duration, and once the time is over, a siren will sound, making it useful for various tasks, workouts, or as a simple alarm. It's built with a clean, intuitive interface for ease of use.

# ‚ú® Features
Start/Stop/Reset Functionality: Standard controls for managing the stopwatch.

Set Custom Time: Ability to set a specific countdown duration (e.g., for a timer).

Siren Notification: A distinct siren sound plays once the set time has elapsed.

Clear and Responsive UI: Designed with HTML and styled with Tailwind CSS for a user-friendly experience on different devices.

Time Display: Shows elapsed time or remaining time in a clear format (e.g., HH:MM:SS).

# ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Conceptually)
The Stopwatch App operates entirely on the client side using JavaScript:

Timer Logic: JavaScript manages the timing, incrementing for a stopwatch or decrementing for a timer based on user input.

UI Updates: The display is updated in real-time using setInterval to reflect the current time.

Time Setting: Users can input a desired time for the countdown feature.

Siren Trigger: When the countdown reaches zero, JavaScript triggers an audio element to play the siren sound.

Event Handling: Button clicks (Start, Stop, Reset) and input changes are handled by JavaScript to control the timer's state.

# üíª Technologies Used
HTML5: For the fundamental structure and content of the web page, including the time display and control buttons.

CSS3 (Tailwind CSS): For all styling, ensuring a responsive, modern, and aesthetically pleasing user interface.

JavaScript: For implementing all the core logic, including timer functions, UI updates, and audio playback for the siren.
