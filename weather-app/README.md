# Weather App
This repository contains the Weather App, a dynamic web application that provides real-time weather information for any city around the world. Built with a focus on a clean design and user-friendly experience, this app allows you to quickly check current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more, all powered by data fetched from a weather API.

# ‚ú® Features
Real-time Weather Data: Fetches up-to-date weather conditions for specified locations.

Location Search: Allows users to search for weather by city name.

Key Weather Metrics: Displays essential information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.

Intuitive User Interface: A clean, modern, and responsive design built with Tailwind CSS for an excellent user experience across various devices.

Dynamic Backgrounds (Conceptual): (If implemented) Changes the background image or color based on current weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).

# ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Conceptually)
The Weather App operates by:

User Input: The user enters a city name into the search bar.

API Call: JavaScript makes an asynchronous fetch request to a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API) with the provided city name.

Data Retrieval: The application receives a JSON response containing the current weather data for that city.

UI Update: The received data is then parsed, and the relevant information (temperature, description, etc.) is dynamically updated on the web page.

Error Handling: (If implemented) Displays appropriate messages if the city is not found or if there's an issue with the API request.

# üíª Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the core elements and content of the web page.

CSS3 (Tailwind CSS): For all styling, ensuring a responsive, modern, and aesthetically pleasing user interface.

JavaScript: For handling user input, making API calls, parsing JSON data, and dynamically updating the UI elements.

Weather API: An external service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API) to provide real-time weather data.

# üöÄ Getting Started
To run the Weather App locally, follow these simple steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Ujjwal01123/Projects

Navigate to the project directory:

cd projects/

Obtain an API Key:

Go to a weather API provider's website (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).

Register for a free account and obtain your API key.

You will need to insert this API key into your JavaScript code where the API call is made. Look for a placeholder like YOUR_API_KEY_HERE.

Open index.html: Simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

That's it! The application should load directly in your browser, ready for you to search for weather.

# üí° Usage
Type the name of a city into the search input field.

Press Enter or click the search button.

View the current weather conditions displayed on the screen.

# üõ£Ô∏è Future Enhancements
5-Day Forecast: Display a forecast for the upcoming days.

Geolocation: Automatically detect the user's current location to show local weather.

Unit Conversion: Allow users to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

More Detailed Data: Include sunrise/sunset times, pressure, visibility, etc.

Search History: Store and display recently searched cities.

Improved Error Handling: Provide more specific feedback for various API errors.
